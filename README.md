# DDoS-Attack-Classification-And-Prediction
The project involves key steps: data preprocessing, exploration, splitting, model training, evaluation, and comparison. Each is essential to build an effective DDoS detection model. We use algorithms like Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Neural Networks to predict and classify attacks, evaluating performance with various metrics.
